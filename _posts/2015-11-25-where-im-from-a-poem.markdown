I am from the King James Bible and the Singer Sewing Machine and the '52 Chevy.

I am from the hand-built house with a smokey fireplace, an outhouse, a grand piano, and hollyhocks by the front door.

I am from catching fireflies in the evening and snapping string beans on the porch swing.

I am from Christmas Eve at First Baptist Church, Hamilton, Ohio and prayer before meals with Floyd and Eleanor and Jerry Winkle.

I am from "Grau-girl" width and the Winkle family nose.

From "God can use a sharp axe better than a dull one" and "when in doubt, don't" and "you can be and do anything."

I am from the church family who was always there and the last to leave. As a child I had a "drug problem" - I was drug to church on Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night and times in between.

I am from Ohio and German hard work, from veggies from the garden and a freezer full of beef raised by an uncle. From a dead end road between Hamilton and Middletown and just inside Fairfield Township.

From a quiet grandmother whose burial featured a perfect double rainbow and a great-grandmother who smoked a corncob pipe.

I am from a pump organ built by a great uncle with his father and dozens of photo albums made by my mother, the products of her Brownie camera.

I am from the dining table where we all gathered every night and now is mine.

Now write your own. Google "[Where I'm FromTemplate](https://www.google.de/search?q=Where+I%27m+From+Template)" and you will find the format and many examples.

This is a fun activity that is likely to call up memories that have been long asleep. Enjoy!
