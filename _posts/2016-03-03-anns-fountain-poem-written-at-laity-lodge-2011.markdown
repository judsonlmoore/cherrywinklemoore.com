Artist's Retreat, 2011. Ian Cron asked us to go experience water and come back in about twenty minutes. This happened. It's taken me six years to share it.


## ANN’S FOUNTAIN


Go to water, he says. Listen to the water. Look at the water.
I go to the fountain by the path on the way to the studios.
It is the first place that comes to mind.
I realize that somehow I have always thought of it as “mine.”
I approach closer than I have before and notice the engraved stone:

_Ann’s Fountain_
_ Fiftieth Anniversary_
_ March 2000_

My own marriage recently saw its fortieth but will not see fifty. This is the year it ends.

Thank you, Ann, for sharing these stones, this water. Long after we and our marriages are history, these stones, this water will remain. Even if this fountain of ours should be dismantled, the stones and the water will go on.
