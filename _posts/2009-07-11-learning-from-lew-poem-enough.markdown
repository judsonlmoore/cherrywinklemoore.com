I have a son
who has severe physical and mental disabilities
and whose life is worth living.
It is worth enriching and cherishing.

Someone asked me:
“When do you know
when you have done enough?”

I wonder:
Would he ask the same question
about his own child?
He implied, I think, that my child
has less value
and should be given fewer opportunities.

“Enough,” you ask?
“Enough” is when Lew’s life is rich:
Full of family,
Full of community,
Full of love.

Cherry Winkle Moore
December 1991
