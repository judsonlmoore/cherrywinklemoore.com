excerpt: David had been a shepherd so when he wrote about God he used imagery he knew.  This
  week I was challenged to use the format of the 23rd Psalm and write a version using
  a title meaningful to me.  I wrote more than one but here is "The Lord is my Master
  Artist."  How would you do this assignment to make it fit your life?

The Lord is my Master Artist

I shall not lack beauty or instruction.

He makes me see the uniqueness in every face and object and situation.

He leads me to the next white canvas and to the next classroom of students.

He renews my vision and my energy.

He leads me in connecting lines to others for his nameâ€™s sake.

Yea, though I walk in darkness and even if blindness should come

I will fear no evil for you are with me.

Your confidence and ability sustain me.

You prepare an exhibit before me in the presence of scoffers.

You anoint my mind and hand and eye.

My Artist Self blossoms.

Surely inspiration and images shall fill all the days of my life

And I shall behold the beauty of the Lord forever.
