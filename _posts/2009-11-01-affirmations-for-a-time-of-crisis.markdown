excerpt: At a crisis time in my life I attended a Women's Retreat at Trinity Baptist
  Church in Lexington, Kentucky.  My mother had recently died and my son, Lew, was
  declining.  The retreat leader (whose name I am sorry I don't recall), gave us each
  a paper with a simple drawing of a flower, a circle in the middle and petals radiating
  out.  We were asked to write a life crisis we had experienced in the middle and
  then write on the petals things we had learned from that time of crisis and growth.  These
  were my comments.

God never left me in the past nor will God leave me now.  God is present and faithful; doing all that God can do.

The people I need to help me will be (or already are) in my life.

I already have everything I need in order to be happy.

I will be grateful every day for each day’s blessings.

I will use expressive means to deal with my feelings.  I will draw or journal or write a poem or song.  I will open myself up to receive God’s messages through many means and share what I receive with others as appropriate.

I will pay attention to my dreams and visions.

I will look for the breakthrough of God’s glory.

I will practice self care.

I will go on retreat even if the time I have is short.  I will practice long, silent listening to God.

I will be able in the future to put this current crisis in the center of my focus and see all the ways God has supported me and opened doors.  I will get to the other side of this.  God who rescued us from so deadly a peril will deliver us again.  (II Corinthians 1:3-11)
