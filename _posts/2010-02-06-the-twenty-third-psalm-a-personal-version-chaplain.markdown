excerpt: Writing a personal version of the 23rd Psalm was assigned in Week Three of
  Disciple's Prayer Life, a study many of us at First Baptist Church in College Station,
  Texas are doing this spring of 2010.  T.W. Hunt who wrote the study guide was a
  seminary professor.  His example begins, "The Lord is My Professor."  I have found
  the process of writing my own to be rich and fascinating.  I recommend it to you.

The Lord is my chaplain.

I shall not lack comfort.

He makes me rest in the palm of his hand.

He leads me to quiet bedsides and to noisy nursing homes.

He refreshes my mind and spirit.

He leads me to the next patient for the sake of his glory.

Yea, though I walk through pain and sorrow filled with feelings of inadequacy

I will fear no evil for you are with me.

Your love and your grace reassure me.

You prepare a blessing for me in the presence of my patients.

You anoint my mind with peace.

My sense of well-being overflows.

Surely your comfort and your presence shall fill all the days of my life

And I shall rest in the shadow of your wings forever.
