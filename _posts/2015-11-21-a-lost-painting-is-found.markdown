This painting was "lost" to me for 41 years. I painted it in 1974 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama where I was a graduate student in the Fine Arts Department. When we were leaving Birmingham in 1976, I left it with a friend. I told her she could have it or take it to Baptist Church of the Covenant and offer it to them. Â I never knew what happened to it after that until recently.

In the summer of 2015 I got an email from a woman who was a member of Baptist Church of the Covenant. She also works in the area of speech and hearing and teaches American Sign Language. She said she had admired the painting for several years and decided to try to find me on the Internet. She wondered if I would be willing for her to acquire the painting. She would buy it if the church was willing to sell it. She would send me money if necessary. I told her that if the church was willing, I was willing for her to have it. After an email exchange with the current pastor, the painting now belongs to her and hangs in her office at The Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Talladega.

Sometimes paintings have interesting stories. I am grateful to know the next chapter of this one.
