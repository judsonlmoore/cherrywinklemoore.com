excerpt: Some thoughts about the dreams I had for Lew.  I guess I could say that these
  dreams have come true but not in the way I had imagined.

The dreams parents have
For their children
Who have disabilities
Are different as those parents
And those children.

One said to me: “I want more for my child
Than the 4 “fs” :
Food
Flowers
Filth
Fetch.”

Another told me,
With bursting pride
Of her child’s task,
Well done,
In food service.

And me?
What dreams do I have for lew?

A potato peeled,
A petunia planted,
A floor polished,
A package delivered:

These are dreams too great
For me to contemplate.

For lew I long for
Love and laughter,
Family, friends,
And freedom.

Cherry Winkle Moore, 1991
