### Making Divine Images Visible

Cherry Winkle Moore is a visual artist and a hospice chaplain. Cherry has a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting, drawing and printmaking from the University of Alabama. Later she completed a Master of Divinity degree with an emphasis in pastoral care. Cherry sometimes says that in her case the MFA stands for Minister of Fine Arts and the MDiv stands for Making Divine Images Visible.

Cherry has a son, Judson, who is a Citizen of the World. He is a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Kyrgyzstan) and has traveled widely. You can read about his adventures at judsonlmoore.com. Her other son, Lew, lives in Heaven.

Cherry was ordained to the gospel ministry in 2000 by Emmanuel Baptist Church in Alexandria, Louisiana and is endorsed as a hospice chaplain by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.

Although Cherry is employed by Hospice Brazos Valley in Bryan, Texas the views expressed here are her own and not those of the agency or of any agency or of any person or organization affiliated or doing business with the agency.
