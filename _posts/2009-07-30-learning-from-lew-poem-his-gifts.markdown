excerpt: 'I read a Reader''s Digest article by Henri Nouwen about his relationship
  with Adam, a man for whom he was a caregiver.  Henri said Adam gave "peace" to his
  life.  I threw the magazine across the room!  I would not say Lew brought me "peace."  So
  then I started thinking how I would answer the question: What did Lew bring to my
  life?  Maybe Henri and I were trying to say the same thing and were using different
  words.  Here''s my answer.'

I have a first-born son
Who is severely disabled
But he brings great gifts to me.

He brings to my life
Sweetness.
He looks at me.
He fully accepts me as I am.
He knows what love is
And because of him
I do, too.

He brings to my life
Focus.
He points my life in new directions.
He opens doors I hadn't seen.
I cannot heal my son
But I can look where he points.
I can go through doors he opens
And I do.

He brings to my life
A new pace.
Because of him I walk more slowly.
I walk more humanly in a fallen world.

My son brings to my life
An abundance of God's grace.
He is a means of grace to me.
He makes me more aware of my blessings.
He will not let me ignore the grief of others.

All of these gifts I would gladly exchange
For a whole son
but that is not mine to choose.

I may choose to thank God
And my son
and I do.

---Cherry Winkle Moore, 1990

In 1990 I was invited to an event at The Sunday School Board, then the name of the publishing house of The Southern Baptist Convention.The two-day event was for people how wrote for the Special Education section then led by Gene Nabi.

On the first night a pastor whose church included many people who had disabilities spoke on the topic “What People Who Have Disabilities Bring to the Church.”I had been thinking about this topic myself.At one point he posed a rhetorical question that was his title.I almost raised my hand…but he went on to tell us some things he had come to believe about the topic.I liked what he had to say.

The next morning I woke up with this poem fully formed in my brain.I shared it later with someone at the meeting and was invited to read it to the group.

But something was wrong with the poem.

I had vowed to myself that I would never write a poem that maintained that Lew’s disabilities were a gift from God.LEW was a gift but, I believe, his disabilities happened because of the fallen state of the world – not God’s specific choice.Some might say this is a distinction without a difference but for me it is important.(How could I love and serve a God who would choose to disable my child?It happened.God choose to stay with us and comfort us and suffer with us.God did all that God could do.)

The original poem was about the gifts of Lew’s life and contained nothing about the pain.Later I added the second-to-last section that says:


<blockquote>All of these gifts I would gladly exchange
For a whole child
But that is not mine to choose.</blockquote>


Even that is not exactly what I wanted to say.That came later in “The Poem I Said I Would Never Write” but at least it made it possible for me to send the poem out into the world.

It is still one of my favorites.  I offer it to you.
