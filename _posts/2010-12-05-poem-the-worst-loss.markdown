**THE WORST LOSS – the death of a child**

They tell me
I have experienced
The Worst Loss.
Why do I recoil?

No one wants to be
The Worst:
The worst parent,
The worst teacher,
Even the worst loser.

That’s part of it.
I don’t want to be
The one at the bottom.
No one does.

But there’s more -
It isn’t true.

The Worst Loss
is any loss
a person tries to walk through
without being held
by the hand of God.
