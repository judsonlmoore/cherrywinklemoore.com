## Retreats

Some content. 

### Instructor: Cherry Winkle Moore, MFA, MDiv

Cherry leads spiritual retreats for women. No two retreats are exactly alike but they combine quiet time alone with God, presentations  on grief and comfort and time for being creative. They draw from Cherry’s experiences as an artist, as a hospice chaplain and as a person who has been held and comforted by God in sorrow.

A sample weekend retreat schedule could look like this:

### Day 1

Session I: “Let God Speak to You”
First creative experience

### Day 2
