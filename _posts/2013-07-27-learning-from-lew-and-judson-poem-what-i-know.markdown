There is a sense in which everything important that I know, I know because of Lew and Judson:

Because of my sons I know pain and joy
I know the fellowship of suffering
and the comradeship of advocacy

I know to appreciate typical childhood development

I know that health and healing are gifts
And that in this life they are most often what we are given

I know the comfort of God

I know the stresses of family life

I know to hold tightly to God
when life throws a right-angled turn

I know how to comfort others

I know heaven is real and that Lew is waiting
