Every Wednesday afternoon a group of portrait artists meets at [The Frame Gallery](https://www.facebook.com/The-Frame-Gallery-193809963977457/) in Downtown Bryan, Texas. Artist and gallery owner Greta Watkins arranges for a model and we paint or draw. This summer I have been doing pastels. Here are some of my portraits from this summer of 2010.

Throughout the year I work thirty hours per week as a chaplain for Hospice Brazos Valley. During the school year I teach one painting class at Blinn College in Bryan, Texas. I often say that there is nothing like fifteen college students at the beginning of their lives to balance all the good-bye in the rest of my life.

In the summer when I am not teaching at Blinn, I attend this portrait group. I hope you have something in your life that balances your work and pain and brings you joy.
